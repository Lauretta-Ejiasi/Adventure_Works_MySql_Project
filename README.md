**Adventure Works SQL Project**

This SQL project was done using MySql and the database used for this project is AdventureWorks database. This is a sample Dataedo documentation - AdventureWorks - Microsoft SQL Server sample database. The AdventureWorks database supports standard online transaction processing scenarios for a fictitious bicycle manufacturer (Adventure Works Cycles). Scenarios include Manufacturing, Sales, Purchasing, Product Management, Contact Management, and Human Resources.

The database can be downloaded from the documentation link below:

· AdventureWorks for SQL Server 2014 (CodePlex)
· AdventureWorks for SQL Server 2012 (CodePlex)
· AdventureWorks for SQL Server 2008R2 (CodePlex)

This project showcases my ability to work with a company's database, which includes tables for offices, employees, products, customers, and payments. The project involves executing various SQL queries to perform tasks such as sorting and filtering data, calculating totals and averages, joining tables, and grouping data based on specific criteria.

The queries in this project cover a wide range of functionalities, including retrieving a sorted list of offices by country, state, and city, determining the number of employees in the company, calculating the total amount of payments received, identifying product lines that include the term 'Cars', and reporting total payments for a specific date.

Additionally, the project involves querying for payments exceeding a certain threshold, listing the products in each product line, determining the number of products in each product line, finding the minimum payment received, and listing payments greater than twice the average payment.
Furthermore, the project explores calculating the average percentage markup of the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) on the buy price, identifying the distinct products sold by ClassicModels, retrieving customer information without assigned sales representatives, and identifying executives with titles containing "VP" or "Manager".

In summary, this SQL project demonstrates my proficiency in working with a relational database, utilizing SQL queries to extract and manipulate data effectively. It showcases my skills in data analysis, sorting, filtering, aggregation, and joining tables to derive meaningful insights from the database.
